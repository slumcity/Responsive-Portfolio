      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/D Picture.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>As a child, I grew up in the midwest until 21 years old when my family moved to Georgia and I started school at UGA. I've worked in the Real Estate Investment industry for the last 7 years, as well as starting my own business in 2012. I buy, renovate and sell homes in the Atlanta area, as well as work as a Regional Better Living Manager at Venterra Realty. My goal is to become a fullstack developer with the intention of developing a few of my own personal ideas I have for some proprietary mobile and web applications. When I'm not working or in school, I enjoy playing guitar and producing music for fun. I'm also really into sports, both watching and playing.</p>
